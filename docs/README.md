# Documentation
This folder can hopefully shed some light on what this app is supposed to do.

## Links
I recommend reading them in this order:

- [Installation](installation.md)
- [Start](start.md)
- [CLI](cli.md)

## Help
If you don't understand some part or want to ask a specific question, feel free to create an issue.
