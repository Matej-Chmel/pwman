# Examples
This directory contains plaintext data that you can use to test the functionality of the app.

## Running the app
For your convenience I added scripts [run.bat](run.bat) and [run.sh](run.sh) to this directory so you can just drag a file onto them and run the app this way.

If can't drag the files, pass their absolute path as a sole argument when running the [main.py](../../src/main.py) with `python -m src.main {path to plaintext file}` from the root directory of this repo.
